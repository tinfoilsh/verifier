# Tinfoil Verifier

Tinfoil's client-side portable remote attestation verifier and secure HTTP client.

[![Build Status](https://github.com/tinfoilsh/verifier/workflows/Run%20tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tinfoilsh/verifier/actions)

## Build instructions

### Native GO
Build
```bash
go build ./...
```

Run tests
```bash
go test ./...
```
### GoMobile
Installing gomobile
```bash
go install golang.org/x/mobile/cmd/gomobile@latest
go install golang.org/x/mobile/cmd/gobind@latest
go get -u golang.org/x/mobile/bind
```

Make sure ```go env GOPATH``` is in your PATH.

#### Objective-C binding for iOS, iOS Simulator, and MacOS
Building iOS target requires the host machine to be running MacOS.
Make sure Go and Xcode are installed and properly configured. 

```bash
gomobile bind -target=ios,iossimulator,macos -o TinfoilVerifier.xcframework $(go list ./... | grep -v "/examples/" | grep -v "/client" | xargs)
```

#### Java binding for Android
Make sure the Android SDK and NDK is installed and properly configured.
This can be done through Android studio or manually.
You will also need to install the Java JDK.

```bash 
gomobile bind -target=android -androidapi 21 -o TinfoilVerifier.aar $(go list ./... | grep -v "/examples/" | grep -v "/client" | xargs)
```


## Quick Start: Use the Secure HTTP Client

```go
// Create a client for a specific enclave and code repository
client := client.NewSecureClient("enclave.example.com", "org/repo")

// Make HTTP requests - verification happens automatically
resp, err := client.Get("/api/data", nil)
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("request failed: %w", err)
}

// POST with headers and body
headers := map[string]string{"Content-Type": "application/json"}
body := []byte(`{"key": "value"}`)
resp, err := client.Post("/api/submit", headers, body)
```

See [Secure HTTP Client](#secure-http-client) for examples of how to use the secure client.

## Remote Attestation

Remote attestation provides cryptographic proof that an enclave is running unmodified code in a secure environment. The verifier supports attestation for **AMD SEV-SNP** and **AWS Nitro Enclaves**.

### Example Usage

```go
// 1. Fetch and verify attestation from an enclave
doc, certFingerprint, err := attestation.Fetch("enclave.example.com")
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to fetch attestation: %w", err)
}

// 2. Verify the attestation's authenticity
measurements, userData, err := doc.Verify()
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("attestation verification failed: %w", err)
}

// 3. Check measurements against known good values from Sigstore
trustRoot, err := sigstore.FetchTrustRoot()
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to fetch trust root: %w", err)
}

measurement, err := sigstore.VerifyAttestation(
    trustRoot,
    attestationBundle, // Need to fetch this from GitHub
    hexDigest,        // Need to fetch this from GitHub
    "org/repo"
)
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("attestation verification failed: %w", err)
}
```

See [Secure HTTP Client](#secure-http-client) for examples of how to use the secure client.

> **Remark:** The certificate fingerprint binds the HTTPS connection to the attested enclave, preventing MITM attacks. This binding ensures you're only connecting to an endpoint whose TLS key material was generated within the verified enclave. An attacker cannot intercept and proxy the connection since they cannot access the private key material.

### How Attestation Works

1. **Document Fetch** (`attestation.Fetch`)
   - Connects to the enclave's attestation endpoint (`/.well-known/tinfoil-attestation`)
   - Retrieves a signed attestation document and the TLS certificate fingerprint
   - The document contains platform-specific proof of the enclave's state

2. **Document Verification** (`Document.Verify`)
   - Validates cryptographic signatures using platform trust roots:
     - SEV: AMD's VCEK certificate chain (pinned in `/attestation/genoa_cert_chain.pem`)
     - Nitro: AWS Nitro attestation verification via [nitrite](https://github.com/blocky/nitrite)
   - Returns the enclave's measurements

3. **Measurement Verification** (`sigstore.VerifyAttestation`)
   - Compares the enclave's measurements against signed reference values
   - Measurements represent the enclave's code and configuration:
     - SEV: Launch measurement (hash of initial memory state)
     - Nitro: PCR values (cumulative hash of loaded components)
   - Reference values are fetched from Sigstore with transparency logging

### Security Properties

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Authenticity** | Attestations are signed by hardware-backed keys (AMD/AWS) |
| **Integrity** | Measurements prove the enclave code hasn't been modified |
| **Identity** | Certificate fingerprint binds HTTPS to the attested enclave |

### Platform-Specific Details

#### AMD SEV-SNP
- Uses AMD's hardware-based attestation with VCEK certificates
- Verifies CPU firmware version and security features
- Launch measurement covers initial memory state and configuration
- [AMD SEV-SNP Specification](https://www.amd.com/en/developer/sev.html)

#### AWS Nitro
- Uses AWS's Nitro Security Module (NSM) for attestation
- PCR measurements track loaded components and configuration
- Supports user data binding for additional context
- [Nitro Enclaves Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/nitro-enclave.html)

### Verification Process

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Enclave
    participant TrustRoot
    participant Sigstore

    Client->>Enclave: Request attestation
    Enclave->>Client: Attestation document + TLS fingerprint
    Client->>TrustRoot: Verify signature
    Client->>Sigstore: Fetch reference measurements
    Client->>Client: Compare measurements
```

### Error Handling

Attestation errors and their meanings:

```go
ErrFormatMismatch      // Attestation format mismatch
ErrMeasurementMismatch // Measurements don't match
```

# GitHub Integration

The verifier integrates with GitHub to fetch release information and attestation bundles:

```go
// Fetch latest release version and attestation digest
version, digest, err := github.FetchLatestRelease("org/repo")

// Fetch attestation bundle for verification
bundle, err := github.FetchAttestationBundle("org/repo", digest)
```

The GitHub integration supports:

- Fetching latest release information via GitHub API
- Retrieving attestation digests from release assets
- Downloading Sigstore attestation bundles for verification
- Backwards compatibility with legacy EIF hash formats

# Secure HTTP Client

The verifier provides a secure HTTP client that ensures all requests are made to a verified enclave. This client:
- Verifies the enclave's attestation before making requests
- Pins TLS connections to the attested certificate

### Security Properties

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Code Verification** | Ensures enclave runs the expected code version |
| **Connection Security** | TLS with certificate pinning prevents MITM attacks |
| **Request Isolation** | Each client connects to exactly one enclave |

### Usage Examples

```go
// 1. Create a client
client := client.NewSecureClient(
    "enclave.example.com",  // Enclave hostname
    "org/repo",            // GitHub repository
)

// 2. Manual verification (optional)
state, err := client.Verify()
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("verification failed: %w", err)
}

// 3. Make HTTP requests
resp, err := client.Get("/api/status", map[string]string{
    "Authorization": "Bearer token",
})

// 4. Use response
if resp.StatusCode == http.StatusOK {
    var data MyData
    json.Unmarshal(resp.Body, &data)
}

// 5. Get raw HTTP client (advanced usage)
httpClient, err := client.HTTPClient()
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to get HTTP client: %w", err)
}
```


## JavaScript Verifier

This verifier is written in Go but is then compiled to a WebAssembly module.
See [verifier-js](https://github.com/tinfoilsh/verifier-js) for details. 


# Auditing the Verifier

1. Audit the pinned certificate [/attestation/genoa_cert_chain.pem](/attestation/genoa_cert_chain.pem)
    - Note: the certificate is taken from [AMD's KDS](https://kdsintf.amd.com/vcek/v1/Genoa/cert_chain)
2. Audit the attestation verification code in [/attestation/attestation.go](/attestation/attestation.go)
   - Verify certificate chain validation
   - Inspect the [/attestation/sev.go](/attestation/sev.go) or [/attestation/nitro.go](/attestation/nitro.go)
3. Audit the measurement verification code in [/sigstore/sigstore.go](/sigstore/sigstore.go)

Note that for Nitro, we use [github.com/blocky/nitrite](https://github.com/blocky/nitrite) to verify the attestation document.
For SEV, we implement the verification following [AMD's specification](https://www.amd.com/en/developer/sev.html).
